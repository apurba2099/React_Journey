# 🚀 React_Joureny

Welcome to my **React Journey**!  
This repo is a collection of everything I've built, learned, and explored on my path from **Beginner** to **Pro** in ReactJS. 🌟

## 📅 Timeline of My Journey

### 📌 1. Getting Started with `Create React App` (CRA)
- ✔️ Setting up basic React projects using CRA
- ✔️ Understanding JSX, Components, Props, and State
- ✔️ Hands-on practice with simple UI projects
- ✔️ Routing with `react-router-dom`

### ⚡ 2. Switching to Vite for Lightning Speed
- ✔️ Migrated from CRA to Vite for faster builds
- ✔️ Understanding module bundlers and ES Modules
- ✔️ Created optimized React apps with Vite setup

### 📈 3. Leveling Up to Pro
- ✔️ Mastered Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.)
- ✔️ Reusable components and prop drilling solutions
- ✔️ Global state management (Context API, Redux)
- ✔️ API Integration (Axios, Fetch)
- ✔️ Routing, Lazy Loading, Code Splitting
- ✔️ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and styled-components
- ✔️ Real-world projects and reusable UI patterns
- ✔️ Deployment using Vercel & Netlify
